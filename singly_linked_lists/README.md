# Singly Linked Lists

## 📚 Description

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on **singly linked lists** in C. A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

You will learn how to:
- Define and use a `struct`
- Allocate and free memory dynamically
- Manipulate pointers
- Traverse and manage linked lists

## 📁 Project Structure

| File Name        | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `0-print_list.c` | Function that prints all elements of a `list_t` list |
| `1-list_len.c`   | Function that returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list |
| `2-add_node.c`   | Function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list |
| `3-add_node_end.c` | Function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list |
| `4-free_list.c`  | Function that frees a `list_t` list |
| `lists.h`        | Header file with struct definition and function prototypes |

## 🛠️ Usage

To compile the files, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c <file>.c -o output
