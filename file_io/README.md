# 0x15. C - File I/O

## üìö Description

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum. It introduces working with **file descriptors**, file permissions, and system calls such as `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close` using the POSIX API in C.

You‚Äôll learn how to:
- Open and create files with specific permissions.
- Read from and write to files.
- Handle error checking when using system calls.
- Use `dprintf` to print to standard error.
- Copy the contents of a file safely and efficiently using a buffer.
