# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## üìö Description

This project is part of the Holberton School low-level programming curriculum. It focuses on the fundamentals of **bit manipulation** in the C programming language.

You will learn how to:
- Represent numbers in **binary**, **decimal**, and **hexadecimal**.
- Use **bitwise operators**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift left/right.
- Set, clear, and get the value of specific bits.
- Count the number of bits needed to change from one number to another.
- Handle binary strings safely in C.
